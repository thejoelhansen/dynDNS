Simple script to keep DNS up to date as cloud IPs change. 

I was tired of paying for static IPs, so I install this script on all my VMs and my DNS stays up to date.

# Installation instructions

1. Rename conf.example -> conf
2. Update variables in conf with your desired DNS record and cloud project & zone parameters
3. Update crontab -e with 
0,15,30,60 * * * * /install/path/dynDNS.sh
